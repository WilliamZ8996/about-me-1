Hello, I was born on August 18 2005. I am an aviation enthusiast who is interested in being an aircraft engineer as a career as well as a small indie game developer just to have an extra revenue source as well as get to learn game environments and objectives. I am also a texture artist for RFS, I make aircraft liveries. I also love pushing myself out of my comfort zone.
